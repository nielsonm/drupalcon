*There is no burrito, so the burrito analogy is gone.*

Distinct layers that work together.

*How do I make my code work better?*

Most of the time, we talk about standards, db query.  This is not that talk.

Solo context.

Back in the day, Drupal had few simple layers.

-Core
-Contrib
-Themes

The contrib layer got complicated, the .API module that allowed crazy extensions of Drupal.
Image module and Views are the poster children for this pure construction kit modules.

Meta modules like Features added another layer of complexity.

hook hook alter - was a little awkward.
