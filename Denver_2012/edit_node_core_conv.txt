I Just Want to Edit a Node
robeano, stevector

Two main questions:
Workflow - lifeline of a node.
Forward revisions - a public revision that will be updated at some later date.

*D7 contrib*

What if D8 did all the handling for revisioning that contrib do now.

*Workflow in core?*

Could be.

Complications include:
-Definition in Workflow
-Workflows across entity types
-State could be an entity
