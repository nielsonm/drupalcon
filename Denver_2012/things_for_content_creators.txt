*About*

This session is not about devs, themers, and PMs.

This is about authors and content creators.

Drupal out of the box is pretty basic.

Drupal gardens provides WYSIWYG, media, gallery.

Drupal++ is functional, but not mind blowing.

*Competitors*
Squiz allows editors to edit text inline.

Plone is a CMS and a CMF, like Drupal.

CQ5 is a proprietary editor focused CMS owned now by Adobe.

Squarespace is a proprietary SAAS.

All three allow inline editing and layout, with slick UI.

*Top 5 things for content creators*

-Real wysiwyg and inline editing
-flexible layout tools
-drag and drop everything
-kick-ass media support
-customized for any device
