The Alice in Wonderland World of Fields and Entities
KarenS

Maintainer of Date and CCK.

It's a topsy turvy world.

*Everything is a node*
4.5
Page and story module were the only content types.
More fields, write code.

4.6
Added flexinode.
-It took off.

4.7
Just like 4.prev, but had CCK
-Custom Content types
-Custom fields

Is everything a node?
-What about comments or users?

5 and 6
No page and story modules
Custom content types
CCK provided custom fields.

Everything is not a node, but fields on everything sounds nice.

7
Custom content types
Custom fields
Entity API

nodes and users are different objects.

There needs to be something deeper than nodes and users.

Entities are fieldable.

*What is an entity?*

Standardized objects

key
label
base table
properties
field integration
-Is it or isn't it fieldable.
caching
bundles
revisions
URI callback
load calback
view callback
form callback
view modes
-e.g. teaser vs. full view for nodes.
translation handlers

New APIs

Field
Entity
EFQ
Entity API (contrib)

Core entities
Node, user, term, comment

Contrib entities
File, block, profile, group

*Why use entities?*

Base table CRUD handled by entity API.
Field CRUD handled by field API.
Automatic Views integration

*Down the rabbit hole*

Terms can have terms.
Enttities can have fields, and vice versa.

Rethinking blocks - bean module.
Rethinking user profiles - profile in d7 core is not the reccommended solution.

Profile2 - profile is attached to a user, but is it's own object.
Profile lite - add fields to user object and add categories.

*Entity subsystems*

Commerce

OG - node groups, but now is it's own entity.

Media

*References*

Entity reference

Entity reference with OG.
-Complete rewrite for 2.0.

*Relation*

Not only do I want to connect two entities, it also makes an entity with relation field (sibling, parent).

*Registration*

Manage registrations for any entities.

*Embeddable*

Embed a block in a user!

*Utilities*

Entity Cache
Entity Cache Flush
Cache Warmer
-Slowly rebuilds cache after flush.

*Entity translation*

Field level translation.

*Entity list*
Views, EFQ

*Building Entities*
UI - ECK
code - model

Bundle switcher
Bundle Copy

If you build your own entity - registry rebuild to fix errors.

Drush entity
Entity autocomplete
auto entity label ANT for entities
view mode modal
taxonomy entity index
entity dependency API

*Fields*

Fieldable fields
Field collection
-Field collection table
-Field collection views
Field group
Field reference
Field formatter settings
Field permissions
Field validation
Field Tools
-Manipulate and work with fields.
Formatter field
-Formats entity instances differently.

*What is a node?*

fields
view modes
access control
revisions
menu items


*Everything can be like a node*
Title

Entity path

Entity Access API
Access Control kit

Entity view modes
